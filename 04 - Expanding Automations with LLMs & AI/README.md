   determine which of the three options applies: positive, negative, or neutral.
   You respond with only one word.
   ```

3. **User Message Setup**
   - Input: `{{$node["On form submission"].json["review"]}}`
   - Processing: Single-word classification output

**Advanced Processing Techniques:**

**Data Merging Strategy:**

if (sentiment === "negative") {
    // Trigger alert email
    // Log to priority queue
    // Create support ticket
}
```

### Testing Scenarios

**Test Case 1: Positive Review**
```
Name: "Sarah"
Review: "This hotel was amazing! Clean rooms, great service, will definitely return."
Expected Output: "positive"
```

## 3. Open-Source LLMs with Ollama

### Core Concept
Deploy and integrate local AI models for private, cost-free automation while maintaining data security and control.

### Learning Objectives
- Install and configure Ollama for local AI hosting
- Select appropriate models based on hardware constraints
- Integrate local models with N8N workflows
- Understand trade-offs between local and cloud AI

### Ollama Installation and Setup

#### System Requirements Analysis

**Hardware Considerations:**
```
VRAM Requirements (Rule of Thumb):
- Model Size ≈ Required VRAM
- 7B model (4.7GB) → Need 5-6GB VRAM
- 14B model (8.2GB) → Need 9-10GB VRAM
- 70B model (40GB) → Need 45+ GB VRAM
```

**Performance vs. Size Trade-offs:**
- **FP16**: Full precision, largest size, best quality
- **Q8**: 8-bit quantization, ~50% size reduction, minimal quality loss
- **Q4**: 4-bit quantization, ~75% size reduction, noticeable quality impact

#### Installation Process

**Step 1: Download Ollama**
1. Visit ollama.ai
2. Click "Download" for your OS (Mac, Linux, Windows)
3. Installation runs automatically in background

**Step 2: Model Selection**
Popular models and their characteristics:
```
Deepseek R1 (7B): Reasoning capabilities, good for math/logic
Llama 3.3 (8B): General purpose, excellent text generation
Mistral (7B): Fast inference, good for simple tasks
Phi-4: Compact model, efficient for basic operations
```

**Step 3: Model Installation**
```bash
# Terminal commands
ollama run deepseek-r1:7b    # Downloads and runs model
ollama serve                  # Starts local server on localhost:11434
```

### N8N Integration Configuration

#### Connection Setup

**Common Connection Issues and Solutions:**

**Problem**: Default localhost connection fails
```
Error: Connection refused to localhost:11434
```

**Solution**: Use IP address instead
1. Check terminal output for server address
2. Replace "localhost" with "127.0.0.1" in N8N credentials
3. Verify port number (default: 11434)

**Correct Credentials Configuration:**
```
Host: 127.0.0.1:11434
Models: [Auto-detected from running Ollama instance]
```

#### Model Performance Testing

**Test Scenarios for Model Validation:**

**Logic Test:**
```
Question: "A train leaves Station A at 2 PM traveling at 60 mph. 
Another train leaves Station B at 3 PM traveling at 80 mph toward Station A. 
If the stations are 300 miles apart, at what time do they meet?"

Expected: Reasoning model should show work and provide correct answer.
```

**Code Generation Test:**
```
Prompt: "Write a Python function to calculate factorial recursively"

Expected: Proper syntax, edge case handling, documentation
```
